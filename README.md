# **Loan Approval Prediction**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval status based on applicant details using Machine Learning techniques.
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains various features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more.

The project is implemented in **Python** using Google Colab and includes the full data processing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling pipeline.
